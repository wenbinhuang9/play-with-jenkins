some jenkins demo

## my understanding of jenkins

Jenkins support the pipelines of build, test, deployment.

We can configure the continuous integration with Git, Docker and deployment system to support efficient test, build and deployment. 

Actually the concept is from CI/CD, and jenkins is a tool used to support CI/CD
